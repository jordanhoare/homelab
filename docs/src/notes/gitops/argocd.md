# ArgoCD and Application Deployment
ArgoCD operates by synchronizing the state of your Kubernetes cluster with the state defined in your Git repository. When you define an ArgoCD Application resource, you're essentially instructing ArgoCD to monitor a specific path in your Git repository and ensure that the cluster's state matches what's defined in that path.

## Namespaces in ArgoCD Application Resources
When you specify a destination in your ArgoCD Application resource, including the namespace, ArgoCD will use this information to determine where to deploy the resources found in the specified path of your Git repository. Here's an example definition that targets a specific namespace:

```zsh
spec:
  destination:
    server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
    namespace: my-apps
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Notes: However, the namespace specified in the Application resource is not strictly where all resources must be deployed. It acts as a default namespace for resources that do not explicitly specify a namespace within their manifests. This setup is useful when you have a collection of resources that are meant to be deployed together but might not specify a namespace within each manifest.

## Dynamic Namespace Management with ArgoCD

For applications like Traefik that are intended to be deployed in their own unique namespaces (e.g., traefik), you have a couple of options:

- Specify the namespace in the manifests: you can explicitly set the namespace within each Kubernetes resource manifest in your /apps/traefik directory. ArgoCD **respects the namespace defined within each manifest**, allowing you to deploy resources across different namespaces dynamically. This approach gives you the flexibility to organize your applications by directories in your repository, with each application potentially targeting its own namespace as defined in its manifests.
- Multiple ArgoCD applications: another approach is to create separate ArgoCD Application resources for different applications or groups of applications that should be deployed in specific namespaces. For instance, you could have one ArgoCD Application resource for Traefik that targets the traefik namespace and another for a different app that targets a different namespace. This method allows you finer control over the deployment process and the sync policies for each set of resources.

By default, the destination.namespace acts as a fallback for any resources that do not specify a namespace. It's a good practice to have this set as a default, even if most of your resources specify a namespace, in case some resources are intended to be deployed to a general or default namespace.
