# Considerations

My current homelab setup serves as a foundational learning environment. It's designed with scalability in mind to eventually adopt practices and technologies more commonly seen in production-grade deployments. When transitioning from a homelab to a production-grade Kubernetes environment, there are key differences and scaling concerns to consider. This section acknowledges these while detailing the current homelab setup and planned upgrades.

## Highly available network load balancing
In production environments, HA network load balancing often involves multiple dedicated hardware or software solutions with automatic failover capabilities. My current homelab uses [kube-vip](https://kube-vip.io/) for simplicity and due to hardware constraints, which provides a single-VIP solution with failover to ensure service continuity. While adequate for small-scale setups, this approach lacks the redundancy of more sophisticated configurations such as dual load balancer setups used in larger clusters.

**Behavioral Note**: Traffic distribution methods vary between solutions like kube-vip, which directs traffic to a leader node, and [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/), which can balance traffic across multiple nodes.



## Network Segmentation and Zero-Trust Access
Future network enhancements will focus on implementing network segmentation to isolate the Kubernetes cluster. This isolation helps mitigate risks and is a step towards a zero-trust network model. Implementing VLANs or similar technologies will provide fine-grained control over network traffic, aligning with zero-trust principles by verifying and minimizing access scopes.

## Cloudflare Tunnel Integration
An additional layer of security and accessibility will be considered through [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/products/tunnel/). This will create secure and private connections between the cluster and the Cloudflare edge, enabling safe exposure of services without exposing the cluster directly to the public internet. This complements the zero-trust approach and provides secure access to services from anywhere, without VPN overhead.
